## Overview

We are building a Shiny app that shows political affiliation over time in counties of North Carolina and filters by race, gender, population density, and age. 

## Goal and Motivation

We aim to observe changes in political affiliation of the counties of North Carolina for the last ten years. We chose North Carolina because it is a swing state so we feel there will be more change in political affiliation and we also vote in North Carolina, so we are interested in understanding the breakdown of voter history here. By examining census data over time, while filtering for race, gender, population density, and age, we hope to rationalize the political changes over time. We are also curious about how major events such as the 2008 recession, COVID-19, and more have impacted political affiliation. Are those in specific categories of race, gender, population density, and age more susceptible to political changes? How has the political affiliation in specific counties or locations in Durham changed over time and is it across all identities or more specific? These are some of the questions we hope to answer when building our Shiny app.

Our goal is to create two maps of North Carolina split by counties, side-by-side. One map will look at each counties political affiliation by coloring each county by the political affiliation of people when they registered to vote (on a red and blue scale) and the other will look at the actual results of the national election in that year (also on a red and blue scale). Both maps will include a feature to filter by different voter stats such as race, population, and age, allowing the user to hover over each county and view only one of these categories or multiple. Additionally, users will be able to filter for counties based on the population metric, race, or age (for example, counties with population sizes greater that 200,000) and will be able to specifically view the political affiliations of the counties that meet the threshold. Users can pick different years for each map (registered vs actual) and see a side-by-side comparison of political affiliations in those elections, additionally based on race, age, and population of those counties.

We plan to use the Shiny interface to create both maps by adding a dropdown function for the filters, a shiny button to generate the map, and utilize behind the scenes functions such as helper, server, and output functions to display the counties that the user has filtered for.

## Data sets

We plan to use 1 data set. This data set comes from the North Carolina State Board of Elections and shows registered voters stats such as race, gender, age, and date of registration. This data set will also show the political party each voter registered as when they signed up to vote.

Data sources: <https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data/voter-registration-data#historical-data>

This data source includes many different variables. The variables we are most interested in are: county_id, `county_desc` (in order to map individuals to a county), `race_code`, `ethnic_code`, `party_cd`, `gender_code`, `birth_year`, `age_at_year_end`, and `registr_dt`.

We will also use a data set of counties in North Carolina for our interactive map.

## Weekly Plan of Attack

-   Week 1: Come up with a plan for the project, finish project proposal, and find data. This will be done by everyone.

-   Week 2: Jordan set up basic structure of Shiny app because she has the most experience with it. Everyone else will become familiar with how Shiny works and then help Jordan when applicable. Additionally, we will work on data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis.

-   Week 3: Work on creating data visualizations. Each person will create their own visualization. 

-   Week 4: Put the data visualizations in the shiny app. Everyone will work on this.

-   Week 5: Finish building the application and deploy it. This will be done by everyone.

-   Week 6: Put final touches on the project, look through rubric to make sure we meet all requirements, practice presentation. This will be done by everyone.

## Organization

We plan to have a data folder in our project repo that stores the dataset files we'll be using. Additionally, we will have a folder of .R files that stores code for helper functions that we'll call into our .qmd file that we'll use for our write-up. We expect to have helper functions that build interactive maps and filter the data. Lastly, we will have a .R file that actually runs our shiny app.
